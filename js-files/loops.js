/* The for loop takes 3 statements inside its parenthesis. The first is called 
initialExpression which is an initialised variable. The second is the condition
and the loop will continue while this statement is true or equal to true. The third
and final statement is called the incrementExpression. Typically we use the increment
operator 'i+' and then decide by how much we want to increment i by.
Then inside the brackets we can create 1 or more statements which will be
executed while the for loops condition is true.
